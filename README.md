# Context-aware GST

This repository contains code supporting the work **"Context-aware gate set tomography: Improving the self-consistent characterization of trapped-ion universal gate sets by leveraging non-Markovianity"**, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02542).

Overview

The implementation primarily utilizes the open-source Python library [pyGSTi](https://www.pygsti.info). Additional dependencies include `numpy`, `scipy`, `math`, `cmath`, `qiskit` and `matplotlib`.

## Repository Structure

`main_functions.py`: Contains essential functions required to perform Gate Set Tomography (GST).
`context_independent_LS_GST.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook which serves as a tutorial to reproduce the findings in the context-independent section of our manuscript (Sec. II).
`context_dependent_LS_GST.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook which serves as a tutorial to reproduce the findings in the context-dependent section of our manuscript (Sec. III).
